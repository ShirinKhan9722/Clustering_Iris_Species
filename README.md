**Problem Statement**

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set To quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.Based on the combination of these four features, we have to distinguish the species from each other.

**Task Objective**

One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other. We need to identify and create the number of clusters w.r.t. the Sepal and Petal features and visually identify which species belong to which class according to their linearity.
